# Gradient descent for univarient linear regression
Jupyter notebook giving a step by step process of how gradient descent works in case of univariate linear regression

Hi All, Machine learning enthusiast out there. If you have keenly got yourself into Machine learning realm, by now you must have realized that Gradient descent is at the crux of finding best hypothesis for our machine learning problem. I have done some effort here to demonstrate Gradient descent in case of the linear regression problem. To make it really easier I have added a Jupyter notebook, which can be readily used on your machine and take a look at my work. (If you want help setup Jupyter notebook. here it is https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) I am really willing to hear back from all of you. Your comments and suggestions are most welcomed. Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn
